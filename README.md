# Scraping-Car-Dealer-website-project
To put Beautiful Soup in Action and gain knowledge about Web Scraping and Data Mining, I worked through this Web Scraping project.
I used through this project: Request, and Beautiful Soup libraries to extract some data points (Name, Mileage, Dealer Name, Price, Rating, rating Count) from the car dealer website and Pandas library to create Data Frame and clean the results, then save the results in a CSV file
